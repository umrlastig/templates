# Templates (PPT, Latex) for oral presentations
You can find here:
* A Powerpoint template: `LASTIG_template_v2_25092025.pptx`
* A beamer template with both an archive `LASTIG_beamer_template_25092025.zip` and the raw sources.

Slight discrepancies exist between both versions, in terms of layout and font, but not a big deal.

Feel free to improve both the PPT and the Beamer templates.
